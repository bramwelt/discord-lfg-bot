Discord LFG Bot
===============

This bot is for running a 'looking-for-group' command on a Discord
server that enables users to signal which games they'd like to party up
with others and play.

User Commands:

 * *!lfg list-games - Lists available games you can find a group for.
      These are set by the server moderators.
 * *!lfg add _game_* - Adds the '_game_' role to your user
 * *!lfg remove _game_* - Removes the '_game_' role from your user

Moderator Commands:

 * *!lfg add-game '_game_' - Creates a new LFG group for
   '_game_'
 * *!lfg remove-game '_game_' - Deletes the LFG group for '_game_'
   removing the role from all users, and archiving the associated
   channel.

Example Usage
-------------
```
!lfg Rocket League
> Rocket League is not an available LFG group
!lfg add-game Rocket League
!lfg list-games
> Game [aliases]
> League of Legends [LoL, league]
> Valorant [val]
> Rocket League [RL]
!lfg Rocket League
> <user> group up in #rocket-league
```

Technicals
----------
The 'groups' are roles assigned to the bot and users who request to be
added to an 'lfg'. These roles map to associated channels that are
hidden to all but the role users. This provides a way to create
user-specific LFG channels without cluttering the list and requiring
users to scroll through _all_ the LFG channels.

OPTIONAL: After a user goes inactive for an hour, they are kicked from
the LFG channel and the role remove from their account.

When the bot goes offline, roles must be re-added by an admin. These
roles corresond to the channels and when they are explicitly removed,
the channels are archived / closed.


Management Notes
----------------

If the bot goes offline, roles will need to be repopulated. The bot will
lookup the channel associated with that role, and for every member of
the channel re-add the role if it doesn't exist, and reset the user's
expiration timer.
